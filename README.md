# Website
The website is mostly retired now and points to the wiki instead.
The hope is that this presents less of a barrier to entry for potential contributors.

If for some reason you need to fix something, it may be helpful to know that this was a 2017-era design using <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/github-pages/">Jekyll and GitHub Pages</a>.

<p>
Since November 2020 we have moved Vampire to a permissive Modified BSD licence (see below). This supersedes all previous licences. 
</p>
<p>
This licence now explicitly allows commercial use of Vampire. 
</p>

<p>
As noted below, some software included with Vampire is available under different licences.
For example, both <a href="https://github.com/niklasso/minisat">minisat</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3">z3</a> are used internally by Vampire.
